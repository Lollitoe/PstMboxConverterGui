## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- libratom library (for PST file parsing)

## Installation

### Option 1: Python Script (Requires Python)

1. Install the required Python library:
```bash
pip install libratom
```

2. Download the `pst_to_mbox.py` script

### Option 2: Standalone Executable (No Python Required)

1. Download all project files including build scripts
2. Double-click `build_exe.bat` to automatically create a standalone .exe file
3. Use the generated `pst-to-mbox.exe` without needing Python installed

**Manual build:**
```bash
pip install pyinstaller libratom
pyinstaller pst-to-mbox.spec
```

Find your executable in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

### Python Script
```bash
# Basic usage
python pst_to_mbox.py input.pst output.mbox

# With verbose output
python pst_to_mbox.py -v input.pst output.mbox
```

### Standalone Executable
```bash
# Basic usage
pst-to-mbox.exe input.pst output.mbox

# With verbose output
pst-to-mbox.exe -v input.pst output.mbox
```

### Examples
```bash
# Python version
python pst_to_mbox.py "MyEmails.pst" "converted_emails.mbox"
python pst_to_mbox.py --verbose "/path/to/outlook.pst" "/path/to/emails.mbox"

# Executable version (Windows)
pst-to-mbox.exe "C:\Users\Name\Documents\Outlook.pst" "emails.mbox"
pst-to-mbox.exe -v "C:\temp\backup.pst" "C:\temp\converted.mbox"
```

## What it does

1. **Opens your PST file** - The tool reads the PST file you exported from Outlook
2. **Extracts all emails** - It goes through every email in all folders
3. **Preserves important data** - Keeps sender, recipient, date, subject, and message content
4. **Handles attachments** - Properly includes file attachments in the conversion
5. **Creates mbox file** - Generates a standard mbox file that most email clients can import

## Importing to Webmail

Once you have the `.mbox` file, you can import it into various email services:

- **Gmail**: Use Google Takeout or third-party tools
- **Outlook.com**: Use the import feature in account settings
- **Yahoo Mail**: Use the import tool in settings
- **Thunderbird**: File > ImportExportTools > Import mbox file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"libratom library is required"** - Install with: `pip install libratom`
2. **"PST file not found"** - Check the file path and make sure the file exists
3. **"Permission denied"** - Make sure you have read access to the PST file
4. **Large files taking time** - This is normal; PST files can be several GB

### Getting Help

Run the tool with `--help` to see all available options:
```bash
python pst_to_mbox.py --help
```

## Technical Details

- **Input Format**: Microsoft Outlook PST files
- **Output Format**: Standard mbox format (RFC 4155)
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes large files without loading everything into memory
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows conversion progress for large files

## Building Executable

To create a standalone Windows executable:

1. **Automatic build**: Double-click `build_exe.bat`
2. **Manual build**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller libratom
   pyinstaller pst-to-mbox.spec
   ```
3. **Find executable**: `dist\pst-to-mbox.exe`

The executable includes all dependencies and works on any Windows computer without Python installation.

### Distribution
